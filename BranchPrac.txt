starting to practicing the branch command
use git checkout -b branchname
to create a branch
git branch
to know in which branch we're existing in
Note:if we commit any files being in an other branch then the files committed to the respective branch and disappears
if we switch to another branch
command to switch to other branch is
git switch branchname
to delete a branch we use
git branch -d branchname
